Island survival game
4 players 45 min - 1 hour play time

Introduction
You and some survivors find yourselves washed up on the beach of an island. Your goal is to survive with these strangers until help arrives. Though your wit, you will try to get off this island while completing your secret objective. This game is played over an unknown number of rounds but ends when there are no remaining survivors on the island. The players who can successfully get off the island win.

Setup

Player setup
Each player receives one character sheet
Each player receives a secret objective card
Each player starts out with 0 cards and must gather them throughout the game.
Board setup
Lay out the game board
Shuffle the food, water and foraging decks and place them in their respective spots

Daily Cycle
All players put their hands face-down in the center of the game board at the start of the gathering phase. Any amount of communication, trading and combat between players can occur during the gathering phase. The gathering phase ends after three minutes or when all players have declared that they have completed all their actions. You and your resources are removed from the game once you have lost all your health points.
Gathering: The number of stars(*) on your card determine the number of actions you may take during this phase. You may use one star(*) from your character card to pull one card from any resource deck or two stars(*) to declare combat against another player. After looking the card, you may either contribute the card to the appropriate community pile or place it face-down in front of you. Resolve any combat (see the Combat section) or trading during the three minutes of this phase, then pull your hand back from the center of the board. Players have a 3 minute time limit for this phase of the game.
Community drawing: In a clockwise circle starting from the youngest character, each player may pull any number of food or water cards from the community piles, placing each card face-up in front of you as you pull it.
Consume resources: At the end of each day, the players will gather together to eat and drink. You must consume at least the amount of food and water points listed on your character card. You are able to consume food or water from any combination of cards that are in your hand or in the community pile (see the Daily Damage section for resolving poison and the difference between the collected cards and your character card). Any leftover cards may added to your hand as long as the number of cards in your hand does not exceed the number of stars on your character card; remaining and used cards are placed face up on the board’s discard pile.
Event trigger: Reveal the top card from the event deck and perform the action that is stated on the card.
Night: All the players will go to sleep. Draw a card from the event deck and do what the card says. Then lose 1 durability to the shelter. If there is no shelter to remove durability from, everyone takes 1 damage.
Combat
Combat works during the timed gathering phase.  To engage in combat the, attacking player will be required to use 1 of a character’s stars(*) and can only happen once per day. Players who wish to engage in combat can use more action points to deal more damage. The defending player may respond by using their action points to defend themselves. The winner of the fight may take one item from the loser’s hand.

Ex: Austin wishes to attack Derrick. In order to attack, Austin must use 2 action points. If Derrick does not wish to defend, derrick can spend 0 action points and take 1 damage and lose those fight. Derrick may use action points to defend himself. Each action point he uses prevents him from taking 1 damage.


 The attacking player(s) will have the ability to use any of the cards that are in their hand to modify their ability to deal damage, then the defending player may do the same.


Daily Damage
    You lose 1 health for each food or drink you are unable to consume.
As you eat and drink, you may reveal poison cards which will cause you to take an extra damage:

Lose 1 health per food / water that you are unable to consume to satisfy the requirement on your card.
Lose 1 health per poison that was revealed while drinking or eating.

After everyone consumes resources, reveal an event card and all the players will go to sleep. If there is no shelter left standing for the night, all players will take 1 damage.

Lose health (if any is specified) on the revealed event card.
Lose 1 health if there is no shelter that is standing at the end of the night.

End of the Game
The game ends when there are no more survivors left on the island. Each surviving player reveals their secret objective and those who have completed them wins.

Event Cards:
Event cards will be written like diaries from the survivors

Calm night - The night was calm, we slept through the night with no issues. I wish every night could be this way.  (Nothing happens)
Light rain - It rained last night. I could feel a few drops as the water seeped through gaps in the roof. (Put one water card from the water deck into the communal water supply.)
Night predator - We could hear something rustling around our camp last night. I peeked out and swear I saw two glowing yellow eyes. (Drawing from the food pile costs two action points for everyone tomorrow,)
Bright idea - We had a good discussion about how to improve the shelter. If we had the right resources, we could try it out. (Add one shelter from the shelter deck for each surviving player/Upgrade the shelter for one less resource tomorrow.)
Fish swarm - It rained all night again. Our fire went out. On the bright side, we woke up to loud splashing in the river. Dozens of fish are swimming through it. (Catch double food tomorrow,[ if fishing]).
Fire! - The fire surged last night and caught the trees and our shelter on fire! We rushed to put it out, but half of our shelter burned down. We need to fix it! (Destroy half, rounding up, of the communal shelter supply)
An Unexpected Guest - We found the craziest thing this morning. A turtle found its way into our water supply! It's a shame that we'll have to eat him, he's kinda cute. Builder called dibs on his shell. (Put one food card from the food deck into the communal food supply. Shuffle 2 poisoned waters from the discard pile into the water deck if they exist there.)
Mosquitos - The bugs were relentless last night. Everyone is covered in little red bumps. Some of us are having a minor allergic reaction. (Everyone takes 1 damage.)
Chupacabra - A sickly looking dog walked into our camp last evening. We tried to catch it or tame it, but it escaped. When we checked our food supplies today, we found them ravished. (Destroy half, rounding up, of the communal food supply)
Lightning - It was a thunderstorm last night. The wind howled, the skies roared, and the air cracked with electricity. It was so cold and frightening, no one could sleep. (Everyone takes 1 damage.)
Boat - Off in the distance we saw a large boat pass by! We lit our fires the best we could  to try to call them over. (if a player has at least 3 wood/shelter cards, that player may select someone, including themselves, to leave the island.)

Add more cards to the water and food decks ? does not have to be +1 or +2 could be more blank and poisons. Players are running out of food and water on turn 8. For now keep the numbers the same but add more stuff in the forrage deck and increase the number of events. See what happens to the survivability after that.
