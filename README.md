# Island Survival Game
IslandSurvivalGame
## Change Log (These Need To Be Put Into The Rules)
Poisoned food and water are just +1 that also makes you lose a health. It makes survival eaiser

When a player goes to drink water, it takes 1 action to drink all the water they need. 1 action to fill a water bottle, etc. Getting food is still 1 action per card.

Because drinking water now only takes 1 action there are ALOT more poisoned water cards in the deck. (like almost 60% poisoned) The new idea is that you can drink from the pool but have a high chance of getting hurt doing 
so. It is better to boil your water then drink it. THis requires that you went out to get a water bottle, and lumber.

Same thing applies to the food. There are more poisoned food cards but you dont just lose health eating a poisoned food card anymore. You use the card, gain the food but also take the damage. This damage is also midigated by cooking the food raising the value of the food by 1. (+1 food becomes +2)

Water deck has no no more blank cards. The idea is that you found your water supply and you go and get water.
Players can use lumber to start a fire to boil their water which negates the effect of poisoned water.

Use lumber to build shelter, or start a fire. Fire is built to purify poisoned water. (THIS HAPPENS DURING THE MAIN PHASE OF THE GAME)

Player cards will have tokens for when they do certain actiaons( THere is a fire token that they can place on 3 pieces of lumber to start a fire for the day.)


## Introduction
You and some survivors find yourselves washed up on the beach of an island. Your goal is to survive with these strangers until help arrives. Though your wit, you must get off this island. This game is played over an unknown number of rounds but ends when there are no remaining survivors on the island. The players who can successfully get off the island win.

## Setup

### Player setup
Each player receives one character sheet
Each player receives a secret objective card
Each player starts out with 0 cards and must gather them throughout the game.

### Board setup
Lay out the game board
Shuffle the food, water and foraging decks and place them in their respective spots

## Daily Cycle
All players put their hands face-down in the center of the game board at the start of the gathering phase. Any amount of communication, trading and combat between players can occur during the gathering phase. The gathering phase ends after three minutes or when all players have declared that they have completed all their actions. You and your resources are removed from the game once you have lost all your health points.

### Gathering 
The number of stars(*) on your card determine the number of actions you may take during this phase. You may use one star(*) from your character card to pull one card from any resource deck or two stars(*) to declare combat against another player. After looking the card, you may either contribute the card to the appropriate community pile or place it face-down in front of you. Resolve any combat (see the Combat section) or trading during the three minutes of this phase, then pull your hand back from the center of the board. Players have a 3 minute time limit for this phase of the game.

### Community drawing 
In a clockwise circle starting from the youngest character, each player may pull any number of food or water cards from the community piles, placing each card face-up in front of you as you pull it.

### Consume resources 
At the end of each day, the players will gather together to eat and drink. You must consume at least the amount of food and water points listed on your character card. You are able to consume food or water from any combination of cards that are in your hand or in the community pile (see the Daily Damage section for resolving poison and the difference between the collected cards and your character card). Any leftover cards may added to your hand as long as the number of cards in your hand does not exceed the number of stars on your character card; remaining and used cards are placed face up on the board’s discard pile.

### Event trigger 
Reveal the top card from the event deck and perform the action that is stated on the card.
Night: All the players will go to sleep. Draw a card from the event deck and do what the card says. Then lose 1 durability to the shelter. If there is no shelter to remove durability from, everyone takes 1 damage.

## Combat
Combat works during the timed gathering phase.  To engage in combat the, attacking player will be required to use 1 of a character’s stars(*) and can only happen once per day. Players who wish to engage in combat can use more action points to deal more damage. The defending player may respond by using their action points to defend themselves. The winner of the fight may take one item from the loser’s hand.

Ex: Austin wishes to attack Derrick. In order to attack, Austin must use 2 action points. If Derrick does not wish to defend, derrick can spend 0 action points and take 1 damage and lose those fight. Derrick may use action points to defend himself. Each action point he uses prevents him from taking 1 damage.


 The attacking player(s) will have the ability to use any of the cards that are in their hand to modify their ability to deal damage, then the defending player may do the same.


## Daily Damage
    You lose 1 health for each food or drink you are unable to consume.
As you eat and drink, you may reveal poison cards which will cause you to take an extra damage:

Lose 1 health per food / water that you are unable to consume to satisfy the requirement on your card.
Lose 1 health per poison that was revealed while drinking or eating.

After everyone consumes resources, reveal an event card and all the players will go to sleep. If there is no shelter left standing for the night, all players will take 1 damage.

Lose health (if any is specified) on the revealed event card.
Lose 1 health if there is no shelter that is standing at the end of the night.

## End of the Game
The game ends when there are no more survivors left on the island. Each surviving player reveals their secret objective and those who have completed them wins.
